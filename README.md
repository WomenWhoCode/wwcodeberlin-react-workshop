## WomenWhoCode React Workshop

The steps to create this simple example can be followed in this [Workshop Overview](STEPS.md).

### What is React

- React is a component-based library.
- every part of your web application can be mapped to a component.
- this is also good for developers as it allows better code splitting -> good separation of conserns and better tests
- the change in one component doen't require the browser to render the whole application -> big advantage compared to other previous libraries / frameworks.
- beneficial when you are building web application where data changes very frequently
- this saves the browser the trouble of reloading the whole application when some change happens.
- it makes it possible to buold more complex user interactions while keeping a good browser performance.

### Why learn React
According to [The State of JavaScript 2018: Front-end Frameworks - React](https://2018.stateofjs.com/front-end-frameworks/react/) React was the most popular FE framework in 2018 in the community, being its most appreciated aspects:
good choice of patterns
good documentation
Rich package ecosystem
It’s a framework which is in high demand in the market
Component based approach makes code splitting and reuse much easier than by developing for the web without any framework

## Before you start
* Install [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
* Make sure that `node` and `npm` are installed. Also, make sure your [node version](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is `6.0.0` or higher.
* Join our slack (we can use to share links and commands more easily)
* Install [React Dev Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi) in Chrome


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
